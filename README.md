# Intro
This is a sad attempt at replicating the letter template from `scrlttr2` in KOMA-Script into `typst`. Please check the example pdf for the result.
# TODO
- [ ] make it work with other paper sizes
- [ ] have fold marks
- [ ] page numbers
- [ ] add backaddress (as described in [])
- [ ] add location (as described in [])
- [ ] its basically non conformant to koma at all
- [ ] make the overall code simpler/better (current layout uses grid)
- [ ] actually use pseudolengths from KOMA-Scipt, maybe use the [typearea package](https://typst.app/universe/package/typearea)
# Reference
from KOMA-Script docs (https://sa.mirrors.cicku.me/ctan/macros/latex/contrib/koma-script/doc/scrguide-en.pdf) starting page 149.

Contributions are welcome. Really, I am still using Latex, I want to switch completely over :D.
